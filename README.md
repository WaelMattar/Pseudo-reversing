Python code package for multiscale analysis via subdivision schemes. The package is complementary to the paper at [https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06261].

The manually-installed libraries needed to run the package are listed in the attached requirements.txt file together with their version.

The package contains 2 files; Reproducing_results contains straightforward scripts to reproduce all the figures of the paper, while the other file comprises the essential functions of multiscaling.

Disclaimer: this code is a work in progress and may contain errors or areas that can be improved. It lacks some robustness, and changing certain parameters may lead to unexpected results. Contributions, suggestions, and corrections are welcome and appreciated.
